```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. a. Show your solutions on how to import a csv file into the environment.
```{r}
library(readr)
mpg <- read_csv("mpg.csv")
head(mpg)
```


1b. Which variables from mpg dataset are categorical?
```{r}
str(mpg) 

#The categorical variables are the manufacturer,model, year,cyl,trans,drv,fl and class

```

1c. Which are continuous variables?
```{r} 
summary(mpg)
#The continious variablesa are the , manufacturer, model, disply, year , cyl, cty ,hwy, fl, trans, drv and class 
```


2. Which manufacturer has the most models in this data set? Which model has the most variations?
Show your answer.
```{r}
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)

model <- mpg %>%
 group_by(manufacturer) %>%
 summarise(count = n()) %>%
 arrange(desc(count))

print(model)

#The manufacturer with the most models is dodge.

count <- mpg %>%
 group_by(model) %>%
 summarise(variation = n()) %>%
 arrange(desc(variation))

print(count)
#The model with most variation is caravan 2wd.

``` 



2.1 a. Group the manufacturers and find the unique models. Show your codes and result.
```{r}
library(dplyr)

manumodel <- mpg %>%
 group_by(manufacturer) %>%
 summarise(unique_models = n_distinct(model)) 

print(manumodel)
```


2.1 b. Graph the result by using plot() and ggplot(). Write the codes and its result.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

plot(ggplot(manumodel, aes(x = reorder(manufacturer, -unique_models), y = unique_models, fill = unique_models)) +
 geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.8) + 
 labs(title = "Number of Manufacturer's Unique Models", 
      x = "Manufacturer",
      y = "Number of Unique Models") +
   
 theme_minimal() +
 scale_fill_gradient(low = "black", high = "pink") +
 theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))) 
```


2. Same dataset will be used. You are going to show the relationship of the model and the manufacturer
a. What does ggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point() show?

Interpret: This generate a scatter plot showing the relationship between car models and their respective manufacturers  using points but the car models are not readable, leads to uninformative data.
```{r} 
 ggplot(mpg, aes(model, manufacturer)) + geom_point() 
```
b. For you, is it useful? If not, how could you modify the data to make it more informative?

Answer: No, The code given is just a basic structure. In modifying this to make it informative I will add color for that will differentiate points based on different variables then a legend to guide viewer to avoid confusion, and adjust the size of variable names with its angle to make it more readable. 
```{r}

#like this code
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = model, y = manufacturer, color = class)) + 
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Car Models and Manufacturers",
       cex = 3,
       x = "Car Model",
       y = "Manufacturer",
       color = "Vehicle Class") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1),
  plot.title = element_text(hjust  = 0.5))
``` 

3. Plot the model and the year using ggplot(). Use only the top 20 observations. Write the codes and
its results.

```{r}

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

data(mpg)


mean_displ_df <- mpg %>%
 group_by(year, model) %>%
 summarise(mean_displ = mean(displ)) %>%
 arrange(desc(mean_displ)) %>%
 filter(row_number() < 20) 

plot <- ggplot(mean_displ_df, aes(x = year, y = mean_displ, fill = model)) +
 geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
 theme_minimal() +
 guides(fill = guide_legend(ncol = 2)) 
 labs(title = "Average Engine Displacement over the years for the top 20 models",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Engine Displacement",
       fill = "Model")

print(plot)
```

4. Using the pipe (%>%), group the model and get the number of cars per model. Show codes and its result
```{r} 

library(dplyr)
data(mpg)


carcountpermodel <- mpg %>%
  group_by(model) %>%
  summarise(num_cars = n())


print(carcountpermodel)


```

a. Plot using geom_bar() using the top 20 observations only. The graphs should have a title, labels and
colors. Show code and results.
```{r}

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

data(mpg)

summary_data <- mpg %>%
  count(model) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  slice(1:20)

top_models <- summary_data$model
palette <- scales::hue_pal()(length(top_models))

summary_data <- summary_data %>%
  mutate(color = palette[match(model, top_models)])

ggplot(summary_data, aes(x = reorder(model, n), y = n, fill = model)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "Top 20 Car Models by Count",
    x = "Car Models",
    y = "Total Cars"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = palette, name = "Car Models", breaks = summary_data$model) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    legend.key.size = unit(0.1, "cm"),
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)  
  )


```
b. Plot using the geom_bar() + coord_flip() just like what is shown below. Show codes and its result.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

data(mpg)

summary_data <- mpg %>%
  count(model) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  slice(1:20)


top_models <- summary_data$model
palette <- scales::hue_pal()(length(top_models))

summary_data <- summary_data %>%
  mutate(color = palette[match(model, top_models)])

ggplot(summary_data, aes(x = reorder(model, n), y = n, fill = model)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(
    title = "Top 20 Car Models by Count",
    y = "Car Models",  
    x = "Total Cars"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = palette, name = "Car Models", breaks = summary_data$model) +
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.key.size = unit(0.1, "cm"),
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)  
  )

```

5. Plot the relationship between cyl - number of cylinders and displ - engine displacement using
geom_point with aesthetic color = engine displacement. Title should be “Relationship between
No. of Cylinders and Engine Displacement”.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

data(mpg)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cyl, y = displ, color = displ)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +  
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between No. of Cylinders and Engine Displacement",
    x = "Number of Cylinders",
    y = "Engine Displacement"
  )

```
a. How would you describe its relationship? Show the codes and its result.

Describe:  Using the line regression to visualize the relationship of the No. of cyl and displ so as the number of cylinders goes up, the engine size tends to increase too.
```{r}

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

data(mpg)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cyl, y = displ, color = displ)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black") +  
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between No. of Cylinders and Engine Displacement",
    x = "Number of Cylinders",
    y = "Engine Displacement"
  )

```

6. Plot the relationship between displ (engine displacement) and hwy(highway miles per gallon). Mapped
it with a continuous variable you have identified in #1-c. What is its result? Why it produced such
output? 

Answer: The scatter plot displays engine displacement (displ) against highway miles per gallon (hwy), while using the color gradient of city miles per gallon (cty) to represent a continuous variable across the points.

Answer: The color gradient based on city miles per gallon (cty) doesn't indicate a direct relationship with engine displacement and highway miles per gallon (displ and hwy), serving instead to visualize the variation in city MPG across the scatter plot.
```{r} 
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

data(mpg)

ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cty)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between Engine Displacement and Highway MPG",
    x = "Engine Displacement",
    y = "Highway MPG"
  ) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "black", high = "pink")  

```

6. Import the traffic.csv onto your R environment.
```{r}
traffic <- read_csv("traffic.csv")
head(traffic)
```

your answer.
```{r}
observations <- nrow(traffic)
variables <- names(traffic)

cat("Number of observations:", observations, "\n")
cat("The variables are:", variables, "\n")

```
b. subset the traffic dataset into junctions. What is the R codes and its output?
```{r}
junctions1 <- subset(traffic, Junction == 1)
junctions2 <- subset(traffic, Junction == 2)
junctions3 <- subset(traffic, Junction == 3)
junctions4 <- subset(traffic, Junction == 4) 

#The output are:
junctions1

and answer.
```{r}
observations <- nrow(alexa_file)
columns <- ncol(alexa_file)

cat("Number of observations:", observations, "\n")
cat("Number of columns:", columns, "\n")

#The number of observations is 3,150 and The number of columns is 5. 
```

b. group the variations and get the total of each variations. Use dplyr package. Show solution and
answer.

  labs(title = "Number of Verified Reviews Over Time",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Number of Verified Reviews",
       color = "Legend Title") +  # Change legend title
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12, labels = month.abb) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue"), labels = c("Reviews")) +  
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

print(p) 

```

e. Get the relationship of variations and ratings. Which variations got the most highest in rating? Plot a
graph to show its relationship. Show your solution and answer.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

variation_ratings <- alexa_file %>%
  group_by(variation) %>%
  summarize(avg_rating = mean(rating))
